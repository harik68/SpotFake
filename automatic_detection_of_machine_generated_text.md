# Detection of AI Generated Text Using AI  
In this blog we discuss some of the latest AI based methods that can detect text that is created using Text Generative Models (TGMs) such as GPT-3.  

TGMs are used for:
- Good Use: Story generation, conversational response generation, code auto-completion and radiology report generation
- Misuse: Fake news generation, fake product reviews, spamming and phising.  

High Level Approach - Formulate the problem as a classification task Human Written Vs Machine Generated Text. Classifier is called **Detector**  

Properties of an Ideal Detector:
1. Accurate: Good trade-off between false positives and false negatives  
2. Data-Efficient: Use minimum samples from TGM of the attacker to classify correctly
3. Generalizable: Detect text generated by different types of TGMs
4. Interpretable: Detector decisions can be understood by Humans
5. Robust: Can handle adversarial examples

## Text Generative Models aka TGMs  
TGMs are usually a Neural Language Model (NLM) trained to model the probability of token given the previous tokens in a text sequence  

$p_{\theta}\(x_t|x_1,...,x_i,...,x_{t-1})$ where tokens coming from a vocabulary $x_i \in V$. If $\b(x) = \(x_1,...,x_{|X|})$ represents a text sequence, then $p_{\theta} = \prod_{t=1}{|X|}\ p_{\theta}\(x_t|x_1,...,x_i,...,x_{t-1})$

If $p*(x)$ denotes a the reference distribution and $D$ denotes a finite set of text sequences from $p*$, TGM estimates parameters $\theta$ by minimizing the objective function
